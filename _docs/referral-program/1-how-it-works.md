On [your referrals page](https://simpleanalytics.io/account/referrals?ref={{ site.hostname }}) you can create a personal referral link which you can share with others. When people signup via your link they will get one month for free. You will get the same amount of that month. After the first payment of the new customer we send that money to your credit card on file. See [the examples](#a-few-examples) further down the page.

## To sum it up

- New customer gets one month (one month extra free trial)
- You get the value of that month (of the new customer)
- Money we send you goes to the same credit card as you have on file

## A few examples

- New customer signs up for the business plan (for $588 a year).
  After they did pay their first invoice **you get $49** ($588 / 12).
- New customer signs up for the starter plan (for $19 a month).
  After they did pay their first invoice **you get $19**.
- New customer signs up for the starter plan (for $19 a month).
  They cancel their plan within one month + 7 days. **You get nothing**.
- New customer signs up for the starter plan (for $19 a month).
  They fail to pay us. **You get nothing**.

## How it works for new customers

When you click the "Get one month for free"-button on the referral page you go to the main sales funnel of Simple Analytics. We will set a cookie with the referral code so we can apply the discount on checkout. You will get one month for free so the trial period is not 7 days but 37 days. During this period (or after) you can always cancel but we don't do refunds.

When you payed your first invoice we will give the promoter of this referral link one month in cash. The promoter will not get your email address or anything else, for them you are anonymous.
